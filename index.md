# About Me
Welcome to my webpage! My name is Cheng-Han Hsieh, and I am a star and planet formation astronomer and a PhD student in the Yale Department of Astronomy.

I am a 6th year PhD candidate at the Yale Astronomy department working with Hector Arce. I received my M.S. and M.Phil from the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2021. I was the 2021 Yale Nathan Hale Associate and was a Yale Henry A. Smith Fellow in 2020. I graduated in 2018 from the National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan) with a Bachelor's degree in Physics. 

Throughout my Ph.D., I explored the intricate world of star and planet formation, spanning an extensive range of physical scales. I conducted dynamical modeling of the first interstellar asteroid, coordinated and led the proposal to conduct radio observations for the first interstellar comet (See [New York Times interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/07/science/interstellar-comet-2i-borisov.html)), and conducted the first statistical study of the disk substructures within young protoplanetary disks with age less than 2 million years old (Class 0/I disks). I also used ALMA to study the interaction between the asymmetric flows of material toward the protostellar disk from the envelope (streamers) and disks, the feedback from protostellar outflows and jets, and angular momentum in a rotating star-forming filament. As a radio observer, I pioneered new methods to measure quantities that are difficult to obtain. I conducted 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations with radiative transfer to test the new methods to measure magnetic fields in the star-forming regions. I developed a new technique to measure protostellar outflow mass, momentum, and energy ejection rates and compute two-dimensional molecular outflow instantaneous rate maps. Additionally, I devised a novel method to determine the mass distribution of the youngest protostars, known as the protostellar mass function (PMF). This theoretical construct is considered a potential precursor to the mass distribution of stars, termed the initial mass function (IMF). See my [Research]({% link research.md %}) section for more information. 

# General Background
I come from Taiwan, and have studied in many countries (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and now USA). In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, reading fatacy novels and economic books, learning about a new language (Japanese), playing the violin, and do photography. I also love to travel and visit museums. See [photos]({% link pictures.md %}).

As a child who grew up in multiple countries and studied in Indonesia for high school, I've interacted with diverse cultures. I am passionate about research, teaching, and outreach, and is interested in promoting equal opportunities for all. See my [Outreach and DEI]({% link outreach.md%}) for more information.
