## Topic#1: Initial Mass Function
Mass is the most fundamental property of a star, as it determines its structure, evolution, and its fate. The Initial Mass Function (IMF), which describes the mass distribution of stars at the beginning of the main sequence phase, is the most important distribution in both stellar and galactic astrophysics. However, there is no current satisfactory theory for the origin of the IMF that can explain both the power-law tail at high masses and the mass at which the peak of the distribution occurs.

Recent STARFORGE simulations show that protostellar outflows can disrupt the accretion flow
around the protostar, allowing gas to fragment and additional stars to form, thereby setting the peak of the IMF to a value similar to that observed. Protostellar outflows are believed to be the main
mechanism that helps disperse the envelope surrounding the protostar (protostellar core), terminate the infall phase, and set the final masses of stars. However, in observational studies of outflows, one major unsolved problem is that the measurements of outflow mass rate, outflow
momentum rate, and outflow energy rate (hereafter, outflow rates), which are important for envelope
dispersal, are uncertain and highly scattered. This resulted in conflicting results even in recent surveys.

During my Ph.D., I investigated the widely used method of estimating outflow rates using a single
dynamical time, spatially averaged over the whole outflow lobe, and found that it is unreliable. To better estimate outflow properties and their impact on their surrounding, I developed a new method, the Pixel Flux-tracing (PFT) technique to measure outflow mass, momentum, and energy ejection rates.
The PFT technique allows us to compute two-dimensional molecular outflow instantaneous rate
maps for the first time. Instead of a single value obtained by previous methods, these two-dimensional
instantaneous rate maps contain spatial information on how the molecular outflow rates vary within the
outflow cavity.

Multiplying the outflow mass-loss rate with the duration of the protostellar phase, we found that by
the end of the protostellar stage, the total mass removed by protostellar outflows is comparable to or even larger than the current mass of the gas surrounding the protostar (protostellar core). This implies that cores must have their mass constantly replenished by mass accretion from the larger scale. With the discovery of a high mass-loss rate from protostellar outflows, the detection of streamers and accretion flows, and evidence of core growth by accretion from the surroundings, raise doubts on the idea of cores as a well-defined mass reservoir. Thus, a well-defined precursor of the IMF is needed to determine the star formation process.

Research Highlight #2: Develop a new method to measure the Protostellar Mass Function
During my Ph.D., I tackled the challenge of measuring the protostellar mass function (PMF), a theoretical construct that has yet to be measured [18, 19]. Traditional mass measuring methods relying on fitting a Keplerian rotation curve in circumstellar disks are impractical for building a sufficient PMF sample size in a reasonable amount of telescope time. To overcome this, I devised a novel approach using protostellar jets to estimate the PMF for protostars.
I developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that exploited the proportionality between accretion luminosity and the product of accretion rate and stellar mass. This model utilizes the mass-loss rate from molecular bullets within high-velocity jets, which acts as a tracer for accretion from the "primary wind" expelled by the disk. Additionally, we compared the accretion-ejection rate ratio from the Bayesian modeling of observational data with different jet-launching models, such as X-wind and disk-wind models, to constrain the jet-launching mechanism.


## Topic#2: When do planets form?
One of the foremost enigmas in the field of planet formation pertains to discerning the relationship
between circumstellar disk properties and the primordial conditions of planetary systems. The advent of high-resolution observations by ALMA has fundamentally transformed our understanding, unveiling intricate substructures within disks. These substructures manifest varied natures - some potentially sculpted by pre-existing planets, while others, such as dense rings, may act as nurseries for the formation of planetesimals and subsequent planet generations. However, previous surveys predominantly target large, luminous disks or more mature Class II disks (for instance, DSHARP, ODISEA, and eDisk), leaving an uncharted domain: a statistical study of disk substructures within young Class 0/I sources. This gap in knowledge restrains our understanding of the early formation of disk substructures and, consequently, the onset of planet formation.

### Sub-giant Asteroseismology

I am interested in using data from space based photometry missions (Kepler and TESS) to study the oscillation properties of sub-giant stars. Since stellar oscillations are connected to the stellar interior structure, studying these stellar oscillations will lead to a better understanding of low mass star evolution through improved measurements of the sizes of convective stellar cores. 

### Cluster Red Giants
I am currently using various ‘peak-bagging’ codes to study the oscillation modes of red giant stars in the Kepler clusters NGC6791 and NGC6819. I am also applying these peakbagging codes to bright giant stars in the field.
