## Topic#1: Initial Mass Function
Mass is the most fundamental property of a star, as it determines its structure, evolution, and its fate. The Initial Mass Function (IMF), which describes the mass distribution of stars at the beginning of the main sequence phase, is the most important distribution in both stellar and galactic astrophysics. However, there is no current satisfactory theory for the origin of the IMF that can explain both the power-law tail at high masses and the mass at which the peak of the distribution occurs.

Recent STARFORGE simulations show that protostellar outflows can disrupt the accretion flow
around the protostar, allowing gas to fragment and additional stars to form, thereby setting the peak of the IMF to a value similar to that observed. Protostellar outflows are believed to be the main
mechanism that helps disperse the envelope surrounding the protostar (protostellar core), terminate the infall phase, and set the final masses of stars. However, in observational studies of outflows, one major unsolved problem is that the measurements of outflow mass rate, outflow
momentum rate, and outflow energy rate (hereafter, outflow rates), which are important for envelope
dispersal, are uncertain and highly scattered. This resulted in conflicting results even in recent surveys.

During my Ph.D., I investigated the widely used method of estimating outflow rates using a single
dynamical time, spatially averaged over the whole outflow lobe, and found that it is unreliable. To better estimate outflow properties and their impact on their surrounding, I developed a new method, the Pixel Flux-tracing (PFT) technique to measure outflow mass, momentum, and energy ejection rates.
The PFT technique allows us to compute two-dimensional molecular outflow instantaneous rate
maps for the first time. Instead of a single value obtained by previous methods, these two-dimensional
instantaneous rate maps contain spatial information on how the molecular outflow rates vary within the
outflow cavity.

Multiplying the outflow mass-loss rate with the duration of the protostellar phase, we found that by
the end of the protostellar stage, the total mass removed by protostellar outflows is comparable to or even larger than the current mass of the gas surrounding the protostar (protostellar core). This implies that cores must have their mass constantly replenished by mass accretion from the larger scale. With the discovery of a high mass-loss rate from protostellar outflows, the detection of streamers and accretion flows, and evidence of core growth by accretion from the surroundings, raise doubts on the idea of cores as a well-defined mass reservoir. Thus, a well-defined precursor of the IMF is needed to determine the star formation process.

I have also performed research related to what studying oscillation waves in intermediate mass main-sequence stars can (or can’t) tell us about their deep interiors. In the following paper, my collaborators and I consider prospects for using pressure modes (p-modes) near the frequency of maximum oscillation power to probe the structure of the near-core layers of main sequence stars with convective cores by constructing stellar model tracks. Within our mass range of interest, the inner turning point of p modes as determined by the JWKB approximation evolves in two distinct phases during the main sequence, implying a sudden loss of near-core sensitivity during the discontinuous transition between the two phases. However, we also employ non-JWKB asymptotic analysis to derive a contrasting set of expressions for the effects that these structural properties will have on the mode frequencies, which do not encode any such transition. We show analytically that a sufficiently near-core perturbation to the stellar structure results in non-oscillatory, degree-dependent perturbations to the star's oscillation mode frequencies, contrasting with the case of an outer glitch. We also demonstrate numerically that these near-core acoustic glitches exhibit strong angular degree dependence, even at low degree, agreeing with the non-JWKB analysis, rather than the degree-independent oscillations which emerge from JWKB analyses. These properties have important implications for using p-modes to study near-core mixing processes for intermediate-mass stars on the main sequence, as well as for the interpretation of near-center acoustic glitches in other astrophysical configurations, such as red giants.

### Sub-giant Asteroseismology

I am interested in using data from space based photometry missions (Kepler and TESS) to study the oscillation properties of sub-giant stars. Since stellar oscillations are connected to the stellar interior structure, studying these stellar oscillations will lead to a better understanding of low mass star evolution through improved measurements of the sizes of convective stellar cores. 

### Cluster Red Giants
I am currently using various ‘peak-bagging’ codes to study the oscillation modes of red giant stars in the Kepler clusters NGC6791 and NGC6819. I am also applying these peakbagging codes to bright giant stars in the field.
