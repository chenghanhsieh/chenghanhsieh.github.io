    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Cheng-Han Hsieh, and I am a star and planet formation astronomer 
       and a PhD student in the Yale Department of Astronomy.</p>

  <h3>Academic background </h3>

    <p>I am expected to received my PhD at Yale University in 2024. I recieved my M.S. and 
    M. Phil. in Astronomy in 2021, where I was the 2021 Yale Nathan Hale Associate and 
    was as a 2020 Yale Henry A. Smith Fellow. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degrees 
    in Physics from the National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan) in 2018. </p>

	M.Phil. Astronomy, Yale University (2021) <br>
	M.A. Astronomy, Yale University (2021) <br>
	B.S. Physics, NTHU (2018) <br>
	
  <h3>General Background</h3>
    
  <!-- I come from Taiwan, and have studied in many countries (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and now USA).
  -->
  <p> I studied in an international school (IB Program) in Jakarta in high school. Grow up with a multicultural background. In my free time, I 
  enjoy playing badminton, reading fatacy novels and economic theories, learning about a new language (Japanese), playing the violin 
  , and taking pictures. I also love to travel and visit museums.</p>

  <p>As a child who grew up in multiple countries and studied in Indonesia for high school, I've interacted with diverse
cultures and witnessed firsthand the impacts of poverty and discrimination. My upbringing cemented my
dedication to promoting equal opportunities for all.
At Yale, I mentored over 6 undergraduates and was a teaching fellow for 4 astronomy classes. I
taught Ivaris Martinez, a Latino/Hispanic undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico, how to
code with Python during the summer. With no prior experience in programming, our journey began with
the basics of the Linux system, gradually progressing to Python programming. I also familiarized her
with radio astronomy tools, particularly CASA, guiding her in producing integrated intensity maps and
position-velocity diagrams. By summer's end, she had acquired foundational skills essential for a radio
astronomer. As a racial minority myself, I understand that one of the biggest problems for minorities to
access graduate-level education is the racial and gender-biased GRE exam. As a member of the Yale
Astronomy and Climate Diversity Committee (ACDC), we successfully convinced the department to
drop the GRE Physics requirement. In addition, I participated in the AstroSibs program as a mentor for
more than 4 years. AstroSib is a student-led professional development program that pairs an
undergraduate student with a graduate student (Big Sib). The mentor gives students advice on courses,
research opportunities, and how to apply to graduate school. I also volunteered as a reviewer for the Yale
undergraduate research journal (YURA) to support the undergraduates’ research community.
I was also the 2022 ALMA Ambassador, a National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)
program to make radio astronomy (ALMA) more accessible to the greater community. I ran the Cycle 9
ALMA proposal preparation workshop at Yale for the northeast coast area. I was the main organizer of
the free 1-day hybrid workshop. I wrote proposals to host the workshop, advertised the event, and
obtained sponsorship from NRAO to prepare all the lectures, invited speakers, and coordinated the
COVID rules. During that time, I was the only graduate student at Yale whose research involved radio
astronomy. I designed lectures to include the hands-on ALMA proposal preparation sections, and I
helped in total of around 25 undergraduates and graduate students from adjacent fields to come up with
ideas and submit ALMA proposals.
Besides making learning opportunities for radio astronomy more accessible to the greater
community, I also worked to give opportunities to early career astronomers to present their work at a
conference. I was one of the main organizers of the 2023 Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet Science
Symposium (ERESVIII @ Yale). I was on the scientific committee, reviewing the registration, sorting
out the abstracts, and completing other administrative tasks. The main purpose of ERES is to provide a
venue specifically for early career researchers to share their research, network, and seek new
collaborations. Over 100 early career astronomer participants from four different countries attended the
conference. We wrote proposals to the Heising-Simons Foundation and secured over 140,000 USD in
funding to cover all participants’ registration fees and provide meals, lodging, and travel funds for those
in need. Significantly reducing the cost of attendance helps ERES to promote diversity, equity, and
inclusion in the field as most attendees (undergraduates) do not have travel funds of their own.
Through my service, teaching, and research, I am committed to making the field a more
welcoming space for scholars from marginalized communities.</p>
